    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://evanhung.com/did2017/images/google_earth.png" title="google search command" ></p>

<p>Perviously I have posted a blog about <a href="http://www.evanhung.com/blog/2012/09/06/8-useful-google-search-tips-and-tricks/">some tips and tricks</a> of searching in google, later on I am wondering is that all? Obviously the answer is no, here is a full list of google search command. Use them with imagination and they will have the potential to become hundreds of google tricks.</p>

<h2>cache:</h2>

<p>Show the cached snapshot of a page
Sample search:
    cache:www.google.com</p>

<p>The cache is the search engine&rsquo;s copy of a page in its index. Google typically caches the first 101K of a page and not the images. The links to the caches are shown in Google&rsquo;s search results and Page Info button on the Google toolbar can be used to access any cache available for the page.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>link:</h2>

<p>List pages which link to a page
Sample search:
    link:www.google.com</p>

<p>The term &ldquo;backlinks&rdquo; is used to describe those links from external sites which point to the page in question. These links are also known as &ldquo;Inbound Links&rdquo; or &ldquo;IBLs&rdquo;. &ldquo;Outbound Links&rdquo; or &ldquo;OBLs&rdquo; are links from your site to other sites. The search engine optimisation world places great emphasis on increasing the number of backlinks a site enjoys because Google&rsquo;s conceptual model uses backlinks as votes. In general terms, a site with more backlinks is more of an authority than a site with fewer backlinks. Not all backlinks are of equal importance. In Google the phrase &ldquo;B.O.&rdquo; is used for &ldquo;Backlink Obsession&rdquo; as a humorous reference for webmasters and optimisers who fixate on gaining links. Google&rsquo;s use of the link command omits the &ldquo;http&rdquo; protocol.</p>

<h2>related:</h2>

<p>List pages which Google consider to be related to another
Sample search:
    related:www.google.com</p>

<p>Related (or similar pages) are worked out by Google&rsquo;s algorithm. This search command allows you to find pages which discuss a similar topic to a page you have already found. For example, a review of Product X is likely to have related pages which also discuss Product X but may simply just be various reviews.</p>

<h2>info:</h2>

<p>Find one specific URL in the search database
Sample search:
    info:www.google.com</p>

<p>Presents limited information about a particular page in Google&rsquo;s index. Typically the command shows the page snippet and title as well as links to the cache or related pages. Typing a fully qualified URL into Google&rsquo;s search produces the same page.</p>

<h2>define:</h2>

<p>Show Google&rsquo;s glossary definations for a term
Sample search:
    define:goofy</p>

<p>Google lists definitions of the keyword harvested from authoritative glossary-esq sites. The definitions are presented in a bullet point format with a link to the authoritative URL in green below. This results page differs from the links to Answers.com in the top right of many standard search result pages.</p>

<h2>site:</h2>

<p>Restrict a search to a single site
Sample search:
    site:www.evanhung.com</p>

<p>The site: command can be used in two ways; to restrict a search to one site or to list all the pages Google has indexed from one site. For example, site:www.searchcommands.com google searches Search Commands* for the word google and site:www.searchcommands.com searches the site for any page and therefore lists them all. The site: command can either include or omit the &lsquo;www&rsquo; in a domain, omitting the www will return all the sub-domains from the domain which Google has found.</p>

<h2>allintitle:</h2>

<p>Restrict a search so that all the keywords must appear in the title
Sample search:
    allintittle:google</p>

<p>This advanced search command restricts results to those pages which have all the keywords in their title tag. The title tag is the mark up to put contents into the bar at the top of the browser (typically blue in Windows XP). The title tag for this page is Google search commands :: Search Commands*.</p>

<h2>intitle:</h2>

<p>Restrict a search so that some of the keywords must appear in the title
Sample search: Search for pages which contain google in the title and search or commands in the title or body tag</p>

<p>Returns pages which have some of the keywords in the title tag. This advanced search command differs from allintitle: in that only the keyword adjacent to intitle:
    intitle:google</p>

<h2>allintext:</h2>

<p>Restrict a search so that all of the keywords must appear in the body text
Sample search:
    allintext:google</p>

<p>Returns pages which have all of the keywords contained within the body tag. This advanced search ignores the title tag which normally has a non trivial significance in Google&rsquo;s algorithm.</p>

<h2>allinurl:</h2>

<p>Restrict a search so that all of the keywords must appear in the page address
Sample search:
    allinurl:google</p>

<p>A page&rsquo;s URL is its address.</p>

<h2>inurl:</h2>

<p>Restrict a search so that some keywords must appear in the page address
Sample search:<br/>
    inurl:google</p>

<p>Lists pages which have one or more of the keywords in their URL. The inurl: command can sometimes be used to restrict searches to specific sites and directories. For example: inurl:searchcommands.com/google/ inurl will return pages with &lsquo;searchcommands.com/google/&rsquo; in their URL and inurl elsewhere on the page.</p>

<h2>OR</h2>

<p>List pages which have at least some of the keywords
Sample search:
    dog OR bear</p>

<p>By default Google searches for almost all the keywords entered (some words like a, the, of, etc are omitted). The OR command is placed between two or more keywords and instructs Google to return pages which contain one or another of the keywords.</p>

<h2>+</h2>

<p>Insist that the search engine includes a given keyword in the search results
Sample search:
    Dreaming + in + digital</p>

<p>Google purposely omits some words from normal searches but the use of the + command instructs the search engine to include them. For example, Google would treat a search for search the commands as a search for search commands as the is ignored but the phrase search +the commands would ensure the word the was included.</p>

<h2>-</h2>

<p>Insist that the search engine omits pages which match a given keyword in the search results
Sample search:
    ebook -food</p>

<p>The - command creates a negative keyword which must not be present on any page Google matches with the rest of the query. For example, football -american is likely to return pages about Soccer.</p>

<h2>~</h2>

<p>Enhance a search to include synonyms for a given keyword
Sample search:
    ~solution
The synonym search is more like an associated word search. With the ~ symbol present before a keyword Google will return pages which contain the keyword or pages which contain words commonly associated with the keyword. Google simply looks as frequencies across the internet to determine which words are associated with which. Words associated with commands are: reference and syntax.</p>

<h2>*</h2>

<p>Include a wildcard match in your search results
Sample search:<br/>
I * you</p>

<p>The order of keywords in a Google search is significant. Adding the asterisk * as a wildcard to the keyphrase instructs Google that one or more other words should appear in that location.</p>

<h2>[#]&hellip;[#]</h2>

<p>Search a range of numbers as a keyword
Sample search:
    champions 1976&hellip;2005</p>

<p>The [#] values are replaced with numbers to form a range. For example, 1976&hellip;2005. Google will search for pages which contain numbers matching the first, the last or any number in the middle of the sequence.</p>

<h2>daterange:</h2>

<p>Restrict a search to any daterange
Sample search:
    daterange:2453638-2453615 search</p>

<p>The daterange command restricts Google&rsquo;s search to pages published between two dates. The date format used in the Julian calendar rather than the traditional Gregorian calendar. You can use Search Commands* Julian date calculator to formulate the correct syntax.</p>

<h2>&ldquo;&rdquo;</h2>

<p>Restrict a search so that the keywords must appear consecutively in a phrase
Sample search:
    &ldquo;search commands&rdquo;</p>

<p>The order of keywords in a Google search is significant but not sacrosanct. Searching for search commands returns pages which simply mention search and commands. The search for &ldquo;search commands&rdquo; returns different results as only pages which mention search commands as a complete phrase are listed.</p>

<h2>safesearch:</h2>

<p>Restrict a search to exclude adult-content Sample search:
    Safesearch:girls</p>

<p>The safesearch command mimics the effects of enabling SafeSearch on the Google preferences panel and excludes adult related content. Unlike other Google commands it is necessary to leave a space between safesearch: and the keyword as placing the keyword directly adjacent to the colon results in odd (often adult) results. For example, safesearch:girls (safesearch is off in this example).</p>

<h2>filetype:</h2>

<p>Restrict a search to a given type of file
Sample search:
    steve jobs filetype:pdf</p>

<p>Google indexes more than just HTML pages. A wide range of different file types, including PDF and .doc files, are found in the search engine. The filetype command restricts searches to documents which match the filetype extension.</p>

<p>The color of the lake is beautiful, but there is one problem with this picture, the DOF is little bit too short, I must have forgot to adjust the aperture.</p>

<p><img src="http://evanhung.com/did2017/images/lake_monger_3.jpg" title="Black Swan" ></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the first time in my life to spot a black swan, if memory serves me correctly.</p>

<p>Beautiful black body with a red break, black swan surely know how to dress.</p>

<p>Here just a few example, it can be used to search any type of files.</p>

<p><strong>6. Block Specific Sites From Search Results</strong><br/>
Remove specific domains from your results using the <code>-site:website.com</code> phrase in your search.</p>

    <link href="http://evanhung.com/did2017/blog/2012/08/21/browser-compatibility-issue/"/>
    <updated>2012-08-21T18:20:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://evanhung.com/did2017/blog/2012/08/21/browser-compatibility-issue</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://evanhung.com/did2017/images/ss.png"></p>

<p>Unfortunately, Octopress does not compatible with some old browser such as IE6 and IE7。 Webpage looks horrible under those browsers. Although most of the click on this blog is from myself, I still don&rsquo;t want anybody to have the chance to see these horrible pages.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s impossible for me to modify the code of octopress to make it compatible with old browsers. So my idea is to add some browser detection code, if it found these old IE browsers then redirect user to a page telling them they should upgrade or change browser.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>After googling a little bit, I found it&rsquo;s actually very easy to detect browser, just a few lines of java script:</p>

<p>Basically it&rsquo;s using regular expression to select a specific userAgent token,  ua.match(); function will return a positive number when selected user token is being found. The user agent token of IE browser is msie x.0, the x representing the version. To jump to certain page when user is using IE6 or 7 simply add :</p>

<pre><code>if (Sys.ie == '7.0' || Sys.ie == '6.0' ) window.location="test.html";;
</code></pre>

<p>After testing the page using IEtester, I found these code working prefectly well, page loading is very fast, it doesn&rsquo;t have any lag at all. what a simple and elegant solution.</p>

<p>I like the design of Monster headphones, especially the detachable cable and it&rsquo;s cable design, but I don&rsquo;t appreciate it&rsquo;s sound quality and price tag. My AKG 518dj headphone is the best headphone in it&rsquo;s price range, but it also came with a long, old fashioned and undetachable cable. So I decide to modify it, make it&rsquo;s cable function just like Monsters, and then give it a Monster cable.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>The modification is actually very easy. The AKG&rsquo;s headphone is well designed and it&rsquo;s very easy to open up, just remove the pads and there are 3 screws that hold each cup together. Untighten them and the cup will split in half, allowing you to get to the driver connections.</p>

<p><img src="http://evanhung.com/did2017/images/518dj-1.jpg"></p>

<p>The 3.5mm socket is from a Sony 3.5mm extension cable, it got an aluminum case, which looks very nice.  The gluing and soldering is very basic, but drilling a perfect hole for the socket is quite difficult. The cup is round shaped and 3.5mm socket must come out at a roughly 30 degree angle. It&rsquo;s impossible to precisely measure how much to drill, so I have to slow down the process, and do it very carefully.</p>

<p>After spending nearly 1 hour to drill the hole using a dremel, and fix the socket with hot glue, I finally got it done.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://evanhung.com/did2017/images/macbook-pro-with-dual-cinema-displays.jpeg"></p>

<p>Some MacBook Pro or Air users may want to disable their internal screen when the laptop is connected to an external display, this is generally <a href="http://osxdaily.com/2011/01/14/turn-off-the-macbook-or-macbook-pro-screen-with-the-computer-still-on/">achieved in two ways</a> but since Mac OS X 10.7 the internal screen is more persistent and wants to stay on.</p>

<p>To disable the internal screen for OS X Lion based laptops, launch the Terminal and enter the following command:</p>

<pre><code>sudo nvram boot-args="iog=0x0"
</code></pre>

<!-- more -->


<p>You’ll need to reboot for changes to take effect, and the internal display will then be completely disabled regardless of whether the Mac is open or closed.</p>

<p>To undo this, you can go back to the Terminal and enter:</p>

<pre><code>sudo nvram -d boot-args
</code></pre>

<p>Then reboot again, or you can just <a href="http://osxdaily.com/2010/11/15/reset-pram-mac/">zap PRAM</a> by holding down <code>Command+Option+P+R</code> during reboot, which clears out the boot-args as well. If you were to disconnect the MacBook Pro from an external video source, zapping the PRAM would be how you’d want to reenable the internal display.</p>

<p>This is the opposite of “<a href="http://osxdaily.com/2010/04/15/how-to-use-a-macbook-or-macbook-pro-with-the-lid-closed-and-hooked-to-an-external-monitor/">clamshell mode</a>” – where the Mac laptop is closed and the screen is still turned on. Clamshell can look nice, but without adequate air flow the Mac may overheat, thus running the computer with the display open is recommended. If you’re going to do this, be sure to set the <a href="http://osxdaily.com/2010/04/27/set-the-primary-display-mac/">primary display</a> so that the menubar, Dock, and alert windows go to the proper screen.</p>

<p>Thanks to Marcus for the tip via a thread on <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3190417?start=180&amp;tstart=0">Apple Discussions</a></p>

    <link href="http://evanhung.com/did2017/blog/2012/03/30/setting-lightdm/"/>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="http://evanhung.com/did2017/images/LightDM.png"></p>

<p>Ubuntu Oneiric comes with a new display/login manager - <code>LightDM</code>. Just like setting <code>GDM</code>, <code>XDM</code> or <code>KDM</code> etc., LightDM can also be set to auto-login by creating a custom file named <code>lightdm.conf</code> under <code>/etc/lightdm</code> directory. This way you can also define your preferred auto-login session.</p>

<p>So, get to a Terminal and run:</p>

<pre><code>gksudo gedit /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf
</code></pre>

<p>If you are doing it from the console, you would need to use &lsquo;nano&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;gedit&rsquo; and &lsquo;sudo&rsquo; instead o &lsquo;gksudo&rsquo;.</p>

<p>In the file that opens up, enter this text:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>[SeatDefaults]
</span><span class='line'>autologin-user=&lt;USERNAME&gt;
</span><span class='line'>autologin-user-timeout=0
</span><span class='line'>user-session=ubuntu
</span><span class='line'>greeter-session=unity-greeter</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<!-- more -->    


<p>Replace &lsquo;<USERNAME>&rsquo; with your username and &lsquo;ubuntu&rsquo; with your preferred session if you want to automatically log in to some other session than regular Unity. These are the most common session options:</p>

<p><code>Ubuntu</code> (regular Unity) :<code>ubuntu</code>  <br/>
<code>Ubuntu 2D</code> (Unity 2D) :<code>ubuntu-2d</code>   <br/>
<code>GNOME</code> (Gnome Shell) :<code>gnome-shell</code>    <br/>
<code>GNOME Classic</code> :<code>gnome-classic</code>  <br/>
<code>GNOME Classic (No effects)</code> :<code>gnome-fallback</code></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the past two days I&rsquo;ve been working my butt off to set up this blog. It&rsquo;s not my first time to set up a website, but it is my first time to set up a octopress site, and host it on a online <code>Rack PasS</code>, and let it pass through china&rsquo;s <code>GFW</code> (a network filter that blocking foreign websites which china government consider as a threat).</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://evanhung.com/did2017/images/logoa.png" width="200" height="200" title="logo" ></p>

<p>I have also slightly alter the site theme. I like the default theme, so I just made a logo using photoshop and slightly changed the background. The difficult part is modify the <code>SASS</code> to let the page header adjust it’s size automatically, so my blog looks better on smartphones or any other handheld device. Octopress is very well organized, but even still, I had no clue what SASS is, and how to modify it.  After guessing and testing all the SASS code of the default theme I kind of figure out how it works. After a few hours of twisting I finally get it done.<!-- more --></p>

<p>Now, take a look at this beautiful syntax highlitght engine it has:</p>

<p>it&rsquo;s one of my wish to have such gorgeous, elegant and user friendly code highlitghter in my blog. I&rsquo;m in heaven!</p>
